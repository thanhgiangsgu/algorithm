There will be at least one word in s.


Code 

class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int size = s.size();
        int l = 0; bool c = 0;
        for(int i = size-1; i>-1; i--){
            if(c && s[i] == ' '){ return l;}
            if(s[i] != ' '){
                l++;
                c = 1;

            } 
        }
        return l;
        
    }
};
