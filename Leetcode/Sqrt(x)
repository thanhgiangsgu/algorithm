Thuật toán : https://yarndev.wordpress.com/2024/02/01/sqrtx/


Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 231 - 1

Code

ublic:
    int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x == 0 || x == 1) {
            return x;
        }
 
        // Binary search
        int left = 1, right = x, result = 0;
 
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
 
            if (mid <= x / mid) {
                result = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
 
        return result;
    }
};
