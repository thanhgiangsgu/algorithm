Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix  is shown below:

1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9  
The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is .

Function description

Complete the  function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers
Return

int: the absolute diagonal difference
Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, , the number of rows and columns in the square matrix .
Each of the next  lines describes a row, , and consists of  space-separated integers .

Constraints

Output Format

Return the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

Code 

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int index;
    int a[101][101];
    int sumA = 0, sumB = 0;
    int ans = 0;
    cin>> index;
    for (int i = 0 ; i <index ;i++)
        for (int j = 0; j< index; j++)
            cin>> a[i][j];
    for (int i = 0 ; i< index; i++)
        {
            sumA += a[i][i];
            sumB += a[i][index - i - 1];
        }
    ans = sumA - sumB;
    if (ans < 0)
        cout<<ans*-1; else cout<<ans;
}
